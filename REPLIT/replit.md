# Georgies Pharmacy Management System

## Overview

Georgies Pharmacy is a comprehensive pharmacy management system built as a web application. It provides a patient portal for managing prescriptions, requesting refills, transferring prescriptions, and communicating with pharmacy staff. The system is designed to streamline pharmacy operations and enhance patient experience.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and production builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Design**: RESTful API with JSON responses
- **Development Server**: Express with Vite middleware for hot reloading
- **Storage**: In-memory storage (MemStorage) for development, with interface for future database integration

### Database Design
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL
- **Schema**: Comprehensive pharmacy management schema including:
  - Patients table with personal information
  - Prescriptions table with medication details and status tracking
  - Refill requests table for prescription refill management
  - Transfer requests table for prescription transfers
  - Chat messages table for patient-pharmacy communication
  - Pharmacy locations table for multi-location support

## Key Components

3. **Form Submissions**: React Hook Form with Zod validation ensures data integrity
4. **Real-time Updates**: Polling mechanism for chat messages (2-second intervals)
5. **State Management**: Server state cached by React Query, UI state managed by React hooks
